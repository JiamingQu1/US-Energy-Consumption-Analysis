# Introduction

Understanding household electricity usage is a critical aspect of advancing energy policy, promoting sustainability, and addressing socioeconomic disparities. Residential electricity consumption represents a substantial portion of global energy demand, making it a key area for targeted interventions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. By analyzing household energy behavior, this project can uncover patterns and drivers of electricity usage, providing essential insights for policymakers, utility companies, and urban planners to design energy-efficient systems that align with sustainability goals.

The analysis aims to explore the factors influencing household electricity usage and costs, providing a comprehensive understanding of how geographic, climatic, housing, and socioeconomic variables interact with energy consumption. Specifically, we will examine:

Geographic and Climatic Impact: Analyze how urbanization levels (UATYP10), heating degree days (HDD65), and cooling degree days (CDD65) affect electricity usage and costs, highlighting regional variations and the influence of climate on energy demands.

Housing Characteristics: Investigate the role of housing types (TYPEHUQ) in shaping energy consumption patterns, considering structural factors such as insulation and appliance use.

Socioeconomic Factors: Assess the relationship between household income (MONEYPY) and electricity usage (KWH), as well as the mitigating effect of energy assistance programs (ENERGYASST20) on energy costs (DOLLAREL).

Energy Burden and Efficiency: Evaluate the total electricity use (KWH) and costs (DOLLAREL) to identify disparities in energy burden and opportunities for promoting energy efficiency.
