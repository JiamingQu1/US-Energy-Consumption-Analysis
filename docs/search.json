    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding household electricity usage is a critical aspect of advancing energy policy, promoting sustainability, and addressing socioeconomic disparities. Residential electricity consumption represents a substantial portion of global energy demand, making it a key area for targeted interventions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. By analyzing household energy behavior, this project can uncover patterns and drivers of electricity usage, providing essential insights for policymakers, utility companies, and urban planners to design energy-efficient systems that align with sustainability goals.\nThe analysis aims to explore the factors influencing household electricity usage and costs, providing a comprehensive understanding of how geographic, climatic, housing, and socioeconomic variables interact with energy consumption. Specifically, we will examine:\nGeographic and Climatic Impact: Analyze how urbanization levels (UATYP10), heating degree days (HDD65), and cooling degree days (CDD65) affect electricity usage and costs, highlighting regional variations and the influence of climate on energy demands.\nHousing Characteristics: Investigate the role of housing types (TYPEHUQ) in shaping energy consumption patterns, considering structural factors such as insulation and appliance use.\nSocioeconomic Factors: Assess the relationship between household income (MONEYPY) and electricity usage (KWH), as well as the mitigating effect of energy assistance programs (ENERGYASST20) on energy costs (DOLLAREL).\nEnergy Burden and Efficiency: Evaluate the total electricity use (KWH) and costs (DOLLAREL) to identify disparities in energy burden and opportunities for promoting energy efficiency.",

Hence, this study mainly uses the RECS dataset, but may include other data sources later in the project based on necessity.",

However, we also want to check if the KWH values are 0 (which may indicate missing data). The check below shows that no KWH values are 0 as well, indicating that there is no potential missing or problematic data within the part of the dataset that we are working with,\n\n\nCode\n# Check KWH column if anything equals to 0\nsum(energy$KWH == 0)\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\nplot_missing(energy, percent = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis check suggests that the section of the dataset we are using for this project is complete and we do not need to work with missing data.",
