    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding household electricity usage is a critical aspect of advancing energy policy, promoting sustainability, and addressing socioeconomic disparities. Residential electricity consumption represents a substantial portion of global energy demand, making it a key area for targeted interventions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. By analyzing household energy behavior, this project can uncover patterns and drivers of electricity usage, providing essential insights for policymakers, utility companies, and urban planners to design energy-efficient systems that align with sustainability goals.\nThe analysis aims to explore the factors influencing household electricity usage and costs, providing a comprehensive understanding of how geographic, climatic, housing, and socioeconomic variables interact with energy consumption. Specifically, we will examine:\nGeographic and Climatic Impact: Analyze climate (BA_Climate), heating degree days (HDD65), and cooling degree days (CDD65) affect electricity usage and costs, highlighting regional variations and the influence of climate on energy demands.\nHousing Characteristics: Investigate the role of housing types (TYPEHUQ) and urbanization levels (UATYP10) in shaping energy consumption patterns, considering structural factors such as insulation and appliance use.\nSocioeconomic Factors: Assess the relationship between household income (MONEYPY) and electricity usage (KWH).\nEnergy Burden and Efficiency: Evaluate the total electricity use (KWH) to identify disparities in energy burden and opportunities for promoting energy efficiency.\nThrough these analysis, we aim to suggest policies targeting specific regions and demographics to increase energy savings.",

    "text": "3.1 Introduction to results\nThe goal of this study is to understand the factors contributing to higher household usage. Based on these factors, we can suggest effective policies, targetting households with specific socio-economic, geographical and habitual characteristics to reduce electrical usage. Before the results, we would like to highlight that instead of analyzing different types of factors (socio-economic, geographical, etc.), we tend to analyze these different categories together to provide more nuanced analysis and suggestions.\nReducing household electricity usage in the United States is crucial for several environmental, economic, and social reasons. The residential sector is a significant contributor to electricity demand, accounting for approximately 37% of total electricity consumption in 2021. By reducing household electricity usage, we can decrease carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate climate change, and lessen the strain on natural resources.\nPlease refer to Annex A for detailed documentation on categorization of variables:\nCode\n# df &lt;- read.csv('recs2020.csv')\n# energy &lt;- df |&gt;\n#   select(state_name, state_postal, KWH, HDD65, CDD65, UATYP10, TYPEHUQ, MONEYPY, ENERGYASST20, BA_climate, COOLCNTL, HEATCNTL, LGTINLED)\n# \n# write.csv(energy, \"recs2020cleaned.csv\")\n\nenergy &lt;- read.csv('recs2020cleaned.csv')\n\naverage_KWH_state &lt;- energy |&gt; \n  group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_KWH = mean(KWH, na.rm = TRUE))\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\n\nCode\njson_data &lt;- toJSON(average_KWH_state, pretty = TRUE)\nwrite(json_data, \"output.json\")",

Through further research, this is because majority of heating in the colder regions primarily rely on sources like natural gas, heating oil, and propane, with natural gas being the most common option in densely populated areas; meaning that electricity is not the primary source of heating in colder areas. This may cause the colder areas to use less electricity in general. On the other hand, AC relies mainly on electricity, therefore explaining the higher usage of electricity in hotter regions (areas with high cooling degree days).\nNote: Average Cooling Days indicates the average amount of cooling required in a year or season, similar definition for Average Heating Days.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(forcats)  # For fct_reorder\nlibrary(ggridges)\ncustom_colors &lt;- c(\"Subarctic\" = 'purple',\n                   \"Very-Cold\" = 'cornflowerblue',\n                   \"Cold\" = 'skyblue',\n                   \"Marine\" = 'aquamarine',\n                   \"Mixed-Humid\" = 'palegreen',\n                   \"Hot-Humid\" = 'palegoldenrod',\n                   \"Mixed-Dry\" = 'lightsalmon',\n                   \"Hot-Dry\" = 'sandybrown')\n\n# Calculate the mean for each BA_climate\nmeans &lt;- energy |&gt;\n  group_by(BA_climate) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_kwh = mean(KWH, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Create ridge plot with mean points\nggplot(energy, aes(\n  x = KWH,\n  y = fct_reorder(BA_climate, KWH, .fun = mean, .desc = TRUE),\n  fill = BA_climate\n)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.7, scale = 1) +  # Ridge plot\n  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = mean_kwh, y = fct_reorder(BA_climate, mean_kwh, .desc = TRUE)), \n             color = \"black\", size = 3, shape = 24, fill = \"white\") +  # Add mean points\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 35000)) +  # Limit x-axis\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Custom fill colors\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ridge Plot of Energy Usage by climate\",\n    x = \"Energy Usage (KWH)\",\n    y = \"Climate\",\n    fill = \"Environment type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 1260\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from temperature, the climate of the area also supplements the argument that the South consumes more electricty, where the humid areas consumes more energy than any other type of areas.

Our observations suggest that policies should focus more on investigating electricity usage in single-family detached housing, as a higher proportion of households living in houses use more electricity. While this is understandable (since there are more areas that require additional electricity usage), it also means that effective policies regulating electricity use in such housing typologies could potentially have a more significant impact.",

Massachusetts has topped the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) State Energy Efficiency Scorecard for several years. The state offers comprehensive incentives for upgrading to energy-efficient appliances and weatherproofing homes.\nAs such, we would want to investigate if there are poor habits leading to higher electricity usage. Specifically, we obtained data for the usage of LED lights in households and cooling control method (for eg., how people use AC).

The fact that there is no significant pattern in a particular group using good or poor cooling control methods suggest that policies should focus on the type of housing in general (as mentioned in the previous part), as opposed to a more nuanced group.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the alluvial plot\nggplot(allu_data, aes(axis1 = MONEYPY_cat, axis2 = LGTINLED, axis3 = TYPEHUQ)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = MONEYPY_cat), width = 1/12) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/8, fill = \"gray\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Income\", 'LED', \"Type of housing\"), expand = c(0.1, 0.1)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Alluvial Plot: Income, LED and housing type\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    fill = \"Income\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this alluvial plot, we observe that the mid and high income groups tend to have more LED light proportions at home. This underlines a potential inaccessibility among the poorer population to LED lights. LED lights are at least twice the price of normal light bulbs, but save more than 80% of electricity. This suggests for policies to enable wider usage of LED lights at least among the lower income population.\n\n\nCode\nselected_states &lt;- c('LA', 'FL', 'MS', 'CA')\n\n# Filter the data for selected states\nfiltered_data &lt;- energy |&gt;\n  filter(state_postal %in% selected_states)\n\naggregated_data &lt;- filtered_data |&gt;\n  group_by(state_name, LGTINLED) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_KWH = mean(KWH, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'state_name'.

This plot highlights regional differences in energy consumption and the potential role of lighting technologies. California’s low consumption and flat trend reinforce its position as a leader in energy efficiency.\nLooking deeper into this, California is recognized as a leader in energy efficiency, largely due to its stringent energy efficiency standards, including Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, which governs building energy use. The primary goal of Title 24 is to reduce wasteful and unnecessary energy consumption in residential and nonresidential buildings. It mandates energy-efficient design in areas such as insulation, windows, lighting, HVAC systems, and building envelopes. For instance, newer updates have included requirements for the adoption of advanced LED lighting, solar panel integration for new homes, and high-efficiency cooling systems to reduce electricity demand during peak periods. The effect can be observed in the plot above, highlighting that California’s policies can be used as a positive case study for the southern states to increase energy efficiency and reduce household electrical usage.",

    "text": "In conclusion we noticed that the States in the south generally experience higher level of electrical usage per household. Due to the difference in usage between the northern and southern States, we suggest that the use of AC may be a huge contributor to this. We also analyzed housing typology along with socio-economic, from which we inferred that the population living in single-family detached housing contribute more to high energy usage. Among them, policies could focus more on the richer population to make more significant electricity savings. Policies on better cooling control method should also focus on all populations, and support the poorer population in using LED lights.\nMoving forward, we could further this research through modeling and add temporal dimension to understand the implications of implemented policies and understand the effectiveness of relevant policies at reducing household electrical usage.\nThank you and may we work towards a greener world!\n\n\n\ndo your part for the world by saving electricity :)",
