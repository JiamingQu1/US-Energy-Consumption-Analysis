# US Energy Consumption Analysis
### By Jeremy Qu and Matt Xi
Understanding household electricity usage is a critical aspect of advancing energy policy, promoting sustainability, and addressing socioeconomic disparities. Residential electricity consumption represents a substantial portion of global energy demand, making it a key area for targeted interventions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. By analyzing household energy behavior, this project can uncover patterns and drivers of electricity usage, providing essential insights for policymakers, utility companies, and urban planners to design energy-efficient systems that align with sustainability goals.

The analysis aims to explore the factors influencing household electricity usage and costs, providing a comprehensive understanding of how geographic, climatic, housing, and socioeconomic variables interact with energy consumption. Specifically, we will examine:

Geographic and Climatic Impact: Analyze how urbanization levels (UATYP10), heating degree days (HDD65), and cooling degree days (CDD65) affect electricity usage and costs, highlighting regional variations and the influence of climate on energy demands.

Housing Characteristics: Investigate the role of housing types (TYPEHUQ) in shaping energy consumption patterns, considering structural factors such as insulation and appliance use.

Socioeconomic Factors: Assess the relationship between household income (MONEYPY) and electricity usage (KWH), as well as the mitigating effect of energy assistance programs (ENERGYASST20) on energy costs (DOLLAREL).

### Insights
In conclusion we noticed that the States in the south generally experience higher level of electrical usage per household. Due to the difference in usage between the northern and southern States, we suggest that the use of AC may be a huge contributor to this. We also analyzed housing typology along with socio-economic, from which we inferred that the population living in single-family detached housing contribute more to high energy usage. Among them, policies could focus more on the richer population to make more significant electricity savings. Policies on better cooling control method should also focus on all populations, and support the poorer population in using LED lights.

Moving forward, we could further this research through modeling and add temporal dimension to understand the implications of implemented policies and understand the effectiveness of relevant policies at reducing household electrical usage.

Thank you and may we work towards a greener world!
