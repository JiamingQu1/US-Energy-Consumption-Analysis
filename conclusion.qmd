# Conclusion

In conclusion we noticed that the States in the south generally experience higher level of electrical usage per household. Due to the difference in usage between the northern and southern States, we suggest that the use of AC may be a huge contributor to this. We also analyzed housing typology along with socio-economic, from which we inferred that the population living in single-family detached housing contribute more to high energy usage. Among them, policies could focus more on the richer population to make more significant electricity savings. Policies on better cooling control method should also focus on all populations, and support the poorer population in using LED lights.

Moving forward, we could further this research through modeling and add temporal dimension to understand the implications of implemented policies and understand the effectiveness of relevant policies at reducing household electrical usage.

Thank you and may we work towards a greener world!
